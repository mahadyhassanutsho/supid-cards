          Congratulations! You've been granted access to absolutely nothing.
          This card certifies that you’ve mastered the ancient art of pretending
          to be busy, professionally avoid responsibilities, and offer
          expert-level eye-rolls in meetings. Flash this card at literally
          anyone to be instantly ignored. Side effects may include inflated ego,
          chronic sarcasm, and allergic reactions to deadlines. Use responsibly
          — or don’t. No one cares.
